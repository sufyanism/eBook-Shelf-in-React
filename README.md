## About
eBook‑Shelf is a minimal web application for showcasing a collection of eBooks. The frontend is built using React (via Vite), and it fetches data from a backend API powered by Express.js. The goal is to have a clean separation between client and server, making it easier to extend (e.g. add CRUD, authentication, etc.).

</br>

## Features
✨ Display a list of books with title, author, and (optionally) other metadata  
✨ Basic API endpoint(s) to fetch book data  
✨ CORS enabled for cross-origin requests  
✨ React-based UI for easy expansion  
✨ Modular architecture (frontend + backend separation)

##  Tech Stack

| Layer          | Technology / Library        |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| Frontend       | React, Vite                  |
| Routing        | React Router DOM             |
| Backend        |         |

</br>

##  Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You should have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- npm (comes with Node.js)  
- (Optionally) `yarn`, if you prefer it over npm  

</br>

### Setup & Run

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sufyanism/eBook-Shelf.git
   cd eBook-Shelf

   Next, initialize a Vite project by typing:
   npm create vite
   ```
If manually then follow these steps,

First, make an ebook shelf folder on your computer.  All of the files for your project will be kept in this folder.
Proceed to the ebook shelf folder by opening the terminal.
Next, type the following to start a Vite project:

```npm create vite```

We want to use the current folder, so use a dot when asked for the project name.
After that, you'll be prompted to choose libraries.  Select the React router dom for this tutorial.
1. Next, choose the framework.  Select React.
2. Next, choose the language.  Select JavaScript.

After creating the project files, type the following to install all dependencies:

Installing NPM
Finally, start the development server with:
```npm run dev```

This will allow you to preview your project in your browser and launch it locally.

2. Setup the **backend**  
   ```bash
   cd src/backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Express server (e.g. on `http://localhost:5000`).

3. Setup the **frontend**  
   In a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   cd src/frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will run the React app (e.g. on `http://localhost:5173` or some similar port).

4. Open your browser to the React app’s URL. The frontend should fetch data from the backend and display the list of eBooks.

5. ➡ [Local Development Server](http://localhost:5173)

##  Project Structure

```
eBook-Shelf/
├── src/
│   ├── backend/           # Express server code
│   │   ├── server.js       # Entry point for backend
│   │   └── …               # Other backend modules, routes, etc.
│   └── frontend/          # React (Vite) application
│       ├── src/            # React components, pages, etc.
│       └── …               
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```
You can extend this structure over time (e.g. adding `routes/`, `controllers/`, `models/`, etc. in backend; `components/`, `pages/`, `services/` in frontend).

</br>

##  API Endpoints

Here are some of the key backend endpoints:

| Method | Path            | Description                          |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/`              | Basic health check (returns a message) |

You can further expand with endpoints for **create**, **update**, **delete** (CRUD) as needed, e.g. `POST /api/books`, `PUT /api/books/:id`, etc.
